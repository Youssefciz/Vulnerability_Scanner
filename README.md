Vulnerability Scanner
======================

Description
-----------
The **Vulnerability Scanner** is a tool designed to scan websites for potential security vulnerabilities. By leveraging the power of multithreading and advanced request handling, this scanner can efficiently crawl websites, identify potential weaknesses, and provide actionable insights for security professionals and developers.

Features
--------
- **Multithreaded Scanning:** Speeds up the scanning process by running multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Customizable Request Headers:** Allows users to define custom headers for more authentic scanning.
- **Dynamic Target Handling:** Supports scanning both single URLs and lists of URLs from files.
- **Random User-Agent Selection:** Uses a variety of user-agent strings to mimic different browsers and devices.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages connection errors and continues scanning without interruptions.

Installation
------------
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssefciz/Vulnerability_Scanner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Vulnerability_Scanner
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Usage
-----
1. **Basic Scan**
   To scan a single website:
   ```bash
   python vulnscan.py -u https://example.com
   ```

2. **Scan Multiple Websites**
   If you have a list of URLs saved in a file (e.g., `websites.txt`), you can scan all of them:
   ```bash
   python vulnscan.py -l websites.txt
   ```

3. **Specify Number of Threads**
   By default, the scanner uses 5 threads. You can customize this number:
   ```bash
   python vulnscan.py -u https://example.com -t 10
   ```

4. **Custom Headers**
   Add custom headers to your requests:
   ```bash
   python vulnscan.py -u https://example.com -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```

5. **Help Menu**
   To view all available options:
   ```bash
   python vulnscan.py -h
   ```

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------
- `-u`, `--url`: Target URL to scan.
- `-l`, `--list`: Path to a file containing a list of URLs to scan.
- `-t`, `--threads`: Number of threads to use for scanning.
- `-H`, `--header`: Custom headers to include in the requests.
