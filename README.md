Multithreaded Scanning: Speeds up the scanning process by running multiple threads simultaneously.
Customizable Request Headers: Allows users to define custom headers for more authentic scanning.
Dynamic Target Handling: Supports scanning both single URLs and lists of URLs from files.
Random User-Agent Selection: Uses a variety of user-agent strings to mimic different browsers and devices.
